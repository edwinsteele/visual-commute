Proof of concept of a cityrail timetable displayed in the same format as
  Edward Tutfe's Japanese war-era train timetable in his "Visual Display
  of Quantatitive Information" book. Data is loaded from the TransXChange
  format files provided by CityRail.

  Requires lxml library.

  Perform a data load with the tool under setup before running the script
  under src. Once run, load the canvas.html file that's produced. Tested
  in Safari v4 but should work in any browser with a working HTML canvas
  implementation.
